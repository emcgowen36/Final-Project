<h1>Family</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This website will explore the Canidae Family and explore the rest of the classifications under the family. Here will be where you can learn about some of the genera that are apart of the Canidae Family. Then you can take a deeper dive into the linked genus below!</p>
<h2>Canidae</h2>
<p>Primarily medium-sized flesh eaters, canids are more omnivorous than many carnivores, taking as food invertebrates, plant matter, and carrion as well as the prey they kill themselves. They are adapted more for endurance than for speed, and they catch prey by pursuit over long distances in relatively open terrain until the prey tires. Kills are made by grabbing for the nape of neck and tackling the prey to the ground. The neck grab is followed by a violent shake, which may dislocate the neck of the prey. Large prey may be immobilized by biting into the soft parts of the underbelly, often resulting in disembowelment and death from shock. Sense of smell is acute and appears to be critical to these animals, as is hearing, but sight is less developed. Canids have deep-chested bodies and a long muzzle. The legs and feet of canids are moderately elongated, and their stance is digitigrade. Usually, five toes are found on the forefeet and four on the hindfeet. The metapodials are long but not fused. Unlike the Felidae, canids have non-retractile claws. This means that they are worn down by activity and are not the specialized weapons found in some other carnivores. All male canids have a well-developed baculum.</p>
<h2>Genera a Part of the Canidae Family</h2>
<p>Every family in biology have their own genera. The genera separates the animals in this family into more specific classifications. Here are some of the most easily recognized genera in this family:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="Genus.html">Canis</a></li>
    <li>Chrysocyon</li>
    <li>Lycalopex</li>
    <li>Urocyon</li>
    <li>Vulpes</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Canis</h2><img src="Images/Canis.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Canis is a diverse genera encompassing 7 species of canids which include jackals, wolves, coyotes, and many subspecies such as the domestic dog. Within the Order Carnivora, this group can be distinguished from others by their relatively large size, elongated rostrum with a well developed skull, including dentition categorized by large canine teeth and a pronounced carnassial pair. This predatory genus feeds on other animals - from small rodents to large herbivores. Given the opportunity they also can consume plant matter making them facultative carnivores. Canids are top predators within the ecosystems they occupy - their diversity enables them to dominate desert, forest, and mountain habits.</p>
<h2>Chrysocyon</h2><img src="Images/Chrysocyon.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>The Maned Wolf, the largest of all South American canids, it stands about three feet tall at the shoulder and has a long, golden-red coat. Head and body length ranges from 49 to 52 in. long and tail length from ll to 16 in. The long thin legs, which may serve to help the maned wolf to see above tall grass, grade from red to black at their lower portions. The anterior part of the erectile mane of long hairs is black as well. The body is narrow and the ears large and erect. The dentition of the maned wolf reflects its food habits. As this animal does not kill or eat large prey, its upper carnassials (shearing teeth) are reduced, its upper incisors weak, and its canines are long and slender.</p>
<h2>Lycalopex</h2><img src="Images/Lycalopex.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>South American fox, (genus Lycalopex), any of six South American carnivores of the dog family (Canidae). Although these canines are not actually foxes, they resemble true foxes. In general, South American foxes are long-haired, rather grayish animals that grow to about 1.6–3.3 feet in length, excluding the bushy tail, which is 10–20 inches long. They are found in open terrain as opposed to thick forest, and they feed on small animals, birds, fruit and other plant material, and insects. Generally nocturnal, they live in abandoned burrows or in dens among rocks or trees. Both parents care for the litters of one to eight young. South American foxes can attack domestic livestock, but they are helpful in controlling rodent populations.</p>
<h2>Urocyon</h2><img src="Images/Urocyon.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Urocyon, derived from the Greek word for “tailed dog”, is a genus of Canidae, the family that is composed of coyotes, dogs, foxes, jackals, and wolves.Diving into the natural history of this taxon, the lineage leading to Urocyon initially diverged from other canids during the Miocene, which was 8-12 million years ago. Research has found that fossil Urocyon, or gray foxes that have gone extinct, has been present in North America since the early Pliocene. Contemporary Urocyon, or gray foxes that are currently extant, is the only extant canid with a natural range spanning both North and South America. Contemporary gray foxes have been classified into 15 subspecies based on morphology, in addition to six subspecies of island fox.</p>
<h2>Vulpes</h2><img src="Images/Vulpes.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>The genus Vulpes is made up of 12 extant species, all referred to as the “true foxes.” There are 6 species only known from fossils. Foxes are part of the Family Canidae which also includes wolves, coyotes, and dogs, but we are able to see some distinct characteristics separating foxes into their own genus. Foxes are distinguished by their small size, flattened skulls with pointed snouts, and a large bushy tail. “Vulpes” means fox in Latin. The best known and most widely distributed species, Vulpes vulpes, was first described by Linnaeus in 1758. Due to the vast land area the red fox occupies, it has been suggested that there may be more genetically distinct species within the genus yet to be described.</p>
