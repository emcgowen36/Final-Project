<h1>Kingdom</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This website will explore the Animalia Kingdom and explore the rest of the classifications under the kingdom. Here will be where you can learn about some of the phylums that are apart of the Animalia Kingdom. Then you can take a deeper dive into the linked phylum below!</p>

<h2>Animalia</h2>
<p>Animal, any member of the Kingdom Animalia, a group of many-celled organisms that differ from members of the two other many-celled kingdoms, the plants and the fungi, in several ways. Animals have developed muscles, making them capable of spontaneous movement, more elaborate sensory and nervous systems, and greater levels of general complexity. Unlike plants, animals cannot manufacture their own food and thus are adapted for securing and digesting food. In animals the cell wall is either absent or composed of material different from that of the plant cell wall. Animals account for about three-quarters of living species. Some one-celled organisms display both plant and animal characteristics. See also algae; arthropod; bacteria; chordate; invertebrate; protist; protozoan; vertebrate.</p>

<h2>Phylum a Part of the Animalia Kingdom</h2>
<p>Every kingdom in biology have their own phylum. The phylum separates the animals in this kingdom into more specific classifications. Here are some of the most easily recognized phylum in this kingdom:
  <ul>
    <li>Annelida</li>
    <li>Arthropoda</li>
    <li><a href="Phylum.html">Chordata</a></li>
    <li>Cnidaria</li>
    <li>Echinodermata</li>
    <li>Mollusca</li>
    <li>Nematoda</li>
    <li>Platyhelminthes</li>
    <li>Porifera</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Annelida</h2><img src="Images/Annelida.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Annelid, any member of a phylum of invertebrate animals that are characterized by the possession of a body cavity, movable bristles, and a body divided into segments by transverse rings, or annulations, from which they take their name. The coelom is reduced in leeches, and setae are lacking a few specialized forms, including leeches. A major invertebrate phylum of the animal kingdom, the annelids number more than 9,000 species distributed among three classes: the marine worms, which are divided into free-moving and sedentary, or tube-dwelling, forms; the earthworms; and the leeches.</p>
<h2>Arthropoda</h2><img src="Images/Arthropoda.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Arthropod, any member of the largest phylum, Arthropoda, in the animal kingdom. Arthropoda consists of more than one million known invertebrate species in four subphyla: Uniramia, Chelicerata, Crustacea, and Trilobita. All arthropods are bilaterally symmetrical and possess a segmented body covered by an exoskeleton containing chitin, which serves as both armour and a surface for muscle attachment. Each body segment may bear a pair of jointed appendages. The phylum includes carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, detritus feeders, filter feeders, and parasites in nearly all environments, both aquatic and terrestrial.</p>
<h2>Chordata</h2><img src="Images/Chordata.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Chordate, any member of the phylum Chordata, which includes the most highly evolved animals, the vertebrates, as well as the marine invertebrate cephalochordates and tunicates. All chordates, at some time in their life cycle, possess a dorsal supporting rod (notochord), gill slits, and a dorsal nerve cord. Unlike vertebrates, tunicates and cephalochordates lack any kind of brain or skeleton. Chordate bodies consist of a body wall encasing a gut, with a space between called the coelom. The body is usually long and bilaterally symmetrical, with the mouth and sense organs at the front end.</p>
<h2>Cnidaria</h2><img src="Images/Cnidaria.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Cnidarian, any of about 9,000 species of mostly marine aquatic invertebrates, constituting the phylum Cnidaria, that are unique in possessing specialized stinging cells (cnidocytes) borne on the tentacles. Cnidocytes contain fluid-filled capsules (nematocysts) with a harpoonlike coiled thread used for stinging, paralyzing, and capturing prey. Cnidarians have no well-defined separate respiratory, circulatory, or excretory organs; their tissues, composed of two cell layers, surround a cavity known as a coelenteron, which is the basic internal organ. Tentacles surrounding the mouth are used to capture and ingest food. Cnidarians are carnivorous, feeding mostly on zooplankton but also on small crustaceans, fish eggs, worms, smaller cnidarians, and even small fish. Cnidarians range in size from nearly microscopic to more than 100 ft long and more than a ton in weight. There are two basic body forms: the polyp (e.g., coral) and the medusa (e.g., jellyfish).</p>
<h2>Echinodermata</h2><img src="Images/Echinodermata.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Echinoderm, any of various marine invertebrates characterized by a hard spiny covering, a calcite skeleton, and five-rayed radial body symmetry. About 6,500 existing species are grouped in six classes: feather stars and sea lilies, starfishes, brittle stars and basket stars, sea urchins, sea daisies, and sea cucumbers. Echinoderms are found in all the oceans, from the intertidal zone to the deepest oceanic trenches. Most species have numerous tube feet that are modified for locomotion, respiration, tunneling, sensory perception, feeding, and grasping. Movement of water through a water vascular system composed of five major canals and smaller branches controls extension and retraction of the tube feet. Most echinoderms feed on microscopic detritus or suspended matter, but some eat plants.</p>
<h2>Mollusca</h2><img src="Images/Mollusca.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Mollusk, any of some 75,000 species of soft-bodied invertebrate animals (phylum Mollusca), many of which are wholly or partly enclosed in a calcium carbonate shell secreted by the mantle, a soft covering formed from the body wall. Between the mantle and the body is the mantle cavity. Mollusks occur in most habitats from the deep sea to high mountains. Living mollusks are usually grouped into eight classes: Gastropoda, Bivalvia or Pelecypoda, Cephalopoda, Scaphopoda, Aplacophora, Caudofoveata, Polyplacophora, and Monoplacophora. Mollusks are economically important as food, and their shells are widely used in jewelry and decorative items.</p>
<h2>Nematoda</h2><img src="Images/Nematoda.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Nematode, any worm of the phylum Nematoda. Nematodes are among the most abundant animals on Earth. They occur as parasites in animals and plants or as free-living forms in soil, fresh water, marine environments, and even such unusual places as vinegar, beer malts, and water-filled cracks deep within Earthâ€™s crust. The number of named species is about 20,000, but it is probable that only a small proportion of the free-living forms have been identified. A great deal of research has been conducted on the parasitic forms because most of them have some medical, veterinary, or economic importance.</p>
<h2>Platyhelminthes</h2><img src="Images/Platyhelminthes.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Flatworm, any of a phylum (Platyhelminthes) of soft-bodied, usually much-flattened worms, including both free-living and parasitic species. Flatworms live in a variety of marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats worldwide. They range in length from much less than an inch to 50 ft and are of three main types: turbellarians, trematodes and cestodes. Flatworms are bilaterally symmetrical and lack respiratory, skeletal, and circulatory systems and a body cavity. Turbellarians are mostly free-swimming, but trematodes and cestodes are parasites.</p>
<h2>Porifera</h2><img src="Images/Porifera.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Sponge, any of some 5,000 species (phylum Porifera) of permanently affixed, mostly marine, solitary or colonial invertebrates, found from shallow to deepwaters. Simple sponges are hollow cylinders with a large opening at the top through which water and wastes are expelled. A thin, perforated outer epidermal layer covers a porous skeleton, which is composed of interlocking spicules of calcium carbonate, silica, or spongin, a proteinaceous material. The body, ranging in diameter or length from 1 inch to several yards, may be fingerlike, treelike, or a shapeless mass. Sponges lack organs and specialized tissue; flagellated cells move water into the central cavity through the perforations, and individual cells digest food, excrete waste, and absorb oxygen. Sponges can reproduce asexually or sexually. Larval forms are free-swimming but all adults are sessile. Since antiquity, sponges have been harvested for use in holding water, bathing, and scrubbing; because of overharvesting and newer technologies, most sponges sold today are synthetic.</p>
