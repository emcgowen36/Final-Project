<h1>Class</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This website will explore the Mammalia Class and explore the rest of the classifications under the class. Here will be where you can learn about some of the orders that are apart of the Mammalia Class. Then you can take a deeper dive into the linked order below!</p>
<h2>Mammalia</h2>
<p>Mammal, any member of the group of vertebrate animals in which the young are nourished with milk from special mammary glands of the mother. In addition to these characteristic milk glands, mammals are distinguished by several other unique features. Hair is a typical mammalian feature, although in many whales it has disappeared except in the fetal stage. The mammalian lower jaw is hinged directly to the skull, instead of through a separate bone (the quadrate) as in all other vertebrates. A chain of three tiny bones transmits sound waves across the middle ear. A muscular diaphragm separates the heart and the lungs from the abdominal cavity. Only the left aortic arch persists. Mature red blood cells in all mammals lack a nucleus; all other vertebrates have nucleated red blood cells.</p>
<h2>Orders a Part of the Mammalia Class</h2>
<p>Every class in biology have their own orders. The orders separates the animals in this class into more specific classifications. Here are some of the most easily recognized orders in this class:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="Order.html">Carnivora</a></li>
    <li>Cetacea</li>
    <li>Chiroptera</li>
    <li>Insectivora</li>
    <li>Marsupialia</li>
    <li>Perissodactyla</li>
    <li>Primates</li>
    <li>Proboscidea</li>
    <li>Rodentia</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Carnivora</h2><img src="Images/Carnivora.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Carnivore, any member of the mammalian order Carnivora, comprising more than 270 species. In a more general sense, a carnivore is any animal (or plant) that eats other animals, as opposed to a herbivore, which eats plants. Although the species classified in this order are basically meat eaters, a substantial number of them, especially among bears and members of the raccoon family, also feed extensively on vegetation and are thus actually omnivorous. The order Carnivora includes 12 families, 9 of which live on land: Canidae , Felidae, Ursidae, Procyonidae, Mustelidae, Mephitidae, Herpestidae, Viverridae, and Hyaenidae. There are three aquatic families: Otariidae, Phocidae, and Odobenidae. These aquatic families are referred to as pinnipeds.</p>
<h2>Cetacea</h2><img src="Images/Cetacea.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Cetacean, any of the exclusively aquatic placental mammals constituting the order Cetacea. They are found in oceans worldwide and in some freshwater environments. Modern cetaceans are grouped in two suborders: about 70 species of toothed whales and 13 species of toothless baleen whales. They have a tapered body, no external hind limbs, and a tail ending in a horizontal blade of two lobes, or flukes. Cetaceans must come to the water’s surface to breathe through blowholes located on top of their head.</p>
<h2>Chiroptera</h2><img src="Images/Chiroptera.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Bat, any member of more than 1,100 species of the only mammals to have evolved true flight. Their wings are evolutionary modification of the forelimbs, with greatly elongated fingers joined by a membrane that extends down the side of the body. Most bats use echolocation to orient themselves and find prey. Found worldwide, they are particularly abundant in the tropics. Wingspreads vary among species from 6 in. to 5 ft. Nearly all species roost during the day (in caves, crevices, burrows, building, or trees) and feed at night. Most are insectivores, consuming enough insects to affect the balance of insect populations. Others feed on fruit, pollen, nectar, or blood (vampire bats). Some may live more than 20 years. The guano of bats has long been used for agricultural fertilizer.</p>
<h2>Insectivora</h2><img src="Images/Insectivora.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Insectivore, any member of the mammalian order (Insectivora) that includes the hedgehogs, moles, and sometimes shrews, or, more generally, any animal that eats mainly insects. The mammalian insectivores are generally small, active, and nocturnal. They are found in most parts of the world except Antarctica, Australia, and South America. Most species are solitary (except during the breeding season) and short-lived.</p>
<h2>Marsupialia</h2><img src="Images/Marsupialia.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Marsupial, any mammal of the order Marsupialia, characterized by premature birth and continued development outside the womb. The young remain attached to the mother’s teats for a period corresponding to the late stages of fetal development of a placental mammal. More than 170 species are found in Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands. About 65 species of opossum occur in the Americas and seven species of ratlike marsupials in South America. Many species have a pouch, a fold of skin covering the nipples on the mother’s lower belly, where the young continue their development.</p>
<h2>Perissodactyla</h2><img src="Images/Perissodactyla.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Perissodactyl, any member of the order Perissodactyla, a group of herbivorous mammals characterized by the possession of either one or three hoofed toes on each hindfoot. They include the horses, asses, and zebras, the tapirs, and the rhinoceroses. The name—from Greek perissos, “odd,” and daktylos, “finger”—was introduced to separate the odd-toed ungulates from the even-toed ones, all of which had previously been classified as members of a single group.</p>
<h2>Primates</h2><img src="Images/Primates.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Primate, any of more than 300 species of the order Primates, including monkeys, apes, humans, and others. Primates are distinguished from other mammals by one or more of the following traits: unspecialized structure, specialized behaviour, a short muzzle, comparatively poor sense of smell, prehensile five-digit hands and feet possessing flat nails instead of claws, acute vision with depth perception due to forward-facing eyes, a large brain, and prolonged pre- and postnatal development. Most species bear a single young and live in troops headed by a male. The primates are one of the most diverse orders of mammals on Earth. They include the lemurs, the lorises, the tarsiers, the New World monkeys, the Old World monkeys, and the apes and humans.The oldest known fossil remains of primates are about 60 million years old.</p>
<h2>Proboscidea</h2><img src="Images/Proboscidea.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Elephant, any of three ungulate species in the order Proboscidea, characterized by their large size, long trunk, tusks, massive legs, large ears, and huge head. All species are grayish to brown, with sparse, coarse body hair. The trunk is used for breathing, drinking, and reaching for food. Elephants eat grasses, leaves, and fruit. The African savanna, or bush elephant, of sub-Saharan Africa, is the largest living land animal, weighing up to 16,500 lbs and standing 10–13 ft tall at the shoulder. The African forest elephant is smaller. The Indian elephant, of South and Southeast Asia, weighs about 12,000 lbs and stands about 10 ft tall. Elephants live in habitats ranging from thick jungle to savanna, in small family groups led by old cows. Most bulls live in bachelor herds. Elephants migrate seasonally. They may eat more than 500 lbs of vegetation daily. All species are considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).</p>
<h2>Rodentia</h2><img src="Images/Rodentia.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Rodent, any member of the order Rodentia, which contains 50% of all living mammal species. Rodents are gnawing, mostly herbivorous, placental mammals. They have one pair of upper and one pair of lower, continuously growing, incisors. When the lower jaw is pulled back, the cheek teeth connect for grinding; when it is pulled forward and down, the incisors meet at the tips for gnawing. Rodent families include squirrels; Old World mice and rats; deer mice, gerbils, hamsters, lemmings, muskrats, wood rats, and voles; beaver; gophers ; guinea pigs; pocket mice and kangaroo rats and mice; New and Old World porcupines; and hutia.</p>
