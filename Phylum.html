<h1>Phylum</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This website will explore the Chordata Phylum and explore the rest of the classifications under the phylum. Here will be where you can learn about some of the classes that are apart of the Chordata Phylum. Then you can take a deeper dive into the linked class below!</p>
<h2>Chordata</h2>
<p>The phylum Chordata consists of animals with a flexible rod supporting their dorsal or back sides. The phylum name derives from the Greek root word chord- meaning string. Most species within the phylum Chordata are vertebrates, or animals with backbones. Examples of vertebrate chordates include fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. A modern human—one species of mammal—is a familiar example of a chordate. However, we share this phylum with two groups of invertebrates as well. Tunicates and lancelets are the only invertebrate groups within the phylum Chordata.</p>
<h2>Classes a Part of the Chordata Phylum</h2>
<p>Every phylum in biology have their own classes. The classes separates the animals in this phylum into more specific classifications. Here are some of the most easily recognized classes in this phylum:
  <ul>
    <li>Amphibia</li>
    <li>Aves</li>
    <li><a href="Class.html">Mammalia</a></li>
    <li>Osteichthyes</li>
    <li>Reptilia</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Amphibia</h2><img src="Images/Amphibia.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Amphibian, any member of a class (Amphibia) of cold-blooded vertebrate animals that includes more than 6,200 species in three groups: frogs and toads, salamanders, and caecilians. Probably evolved from certain fish species of the Early Devonian Epoch, amphibians were the first vertebrates to move from an aquatic environment to land. Most species have an aquatic larval, or tadpole, stage that metamorphoses into a terrestrial adult, but a few species spend their entire life in water. Amphibians are found worldwide, the majority in the tropics.</p>
<h2>Aves</h2><img src="Images/Aves.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Bird, any of the warm-blooded, beaked vertebrates of the class Aves, including more than 9,600 living species. A covering of feathers distinguishes birds from all other animals. Birds have a four-chambered heart (like mammals), forelimbs modified into wings, and keen vision, and their eggs have calcium-rich eggshells. Their sense of smell is not highly developed. Birds are found almost worldwide in diverse habitats on both land and water. Dietary preferences and nest structure vary widely. Almost all species incubate their eggs. Flying birds have evolved skeletons in which part of the bone is replaced by air spaces, an adaptation for reducing weight. The crop, an enlarged part of the esophagus used for temporary food storage, enables birds to feed while in flight. Humans use wild and domesticated birds and their eggs for food, hunt wild birds for sport, and use feathers for decoration and insulation. More than 1,000 extinct species of bird have been identified from fossil remains; the earliest fossil bird known is Archaeopteryx.</p>
<h2>Mammalia</h2><img id="Image" src="Images/Mammalia.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Mammal, any member of the class (Mammalia) of warm-blooded vertebrates having four limbs (except for some aquatic species) and distinguished from other chordate classes by the female’s milk-secreting glands and the presence of hair at some stage of development. Other unique characteristics include a jaw hinged directly to the skull, hearing through bones in the middle ear, a muscular diaphragm separating the pectoral and abdominal cavities, and nonnucleated mature red blood cells. Mammals range in size from tiny bats and shrews to the enormous blue whale. Monotremes lay eggs; all other mammals bear live young. Marsupial newborns complete their development outside the womb, sometimes in a pouchlike structure. Placental mammals are born at a relatively advanced stage of development. The earliest mammals date from the late Triassic Period; their immediate ancestors were the reptilian therapsids. For 70 million years mammals have been the dominant animals in terrestrial ecosystems, a consequence of two principal factors: the great behavioral adaptability provided by the ability of mammalian young to learn from their elders and the physical adaptability to a wide range of climates and conditions provided by their warm-bloodedness.</p>
<h2>Osteichthyes</h2><img src="Images/Osteichthyes.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Bony fish, (class Osteichthyes), any member of the class Osteichthyes, including the great majority of living fishes and virtually all the world’s sport and commercial fishes. The scientific term Pisces has also been used to identify this group of fishes. Osteichthyes excludes the jawless fishes of the class Agnatha and the cartilaginous fishes constituting the class Chondrichthyes but includes the 29,000 species and more than 400 families of modern bony fishes of the world, as well as a few primitive forms. The primary characteristic of bony fishes is a skeleton at least partly composed of true bone. Other features include, in most forms, the presence of a swim bladder, gill covers over the gill chamber, bony platelike scales, a skull with sutures, and external fertilization of eggs. Bony fishes occur in all freshwater and ocean environments, including caves, deep-sea habitats, and thermal springs and vents. The variety of shapes and behavioral habits is remarkable. Their body sizes range from tiny species such as the pygmy goby to the enormous marlins and swordfishes with lengths up to 15 feet and the ocean sunfish, which may weigh over 1 ton.</p>
<h2>Reptilia</h2><img src="Images/Reptilia.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Reptile, any of the approximately 8,700 species of the class Reptilia, the group of air-breathing vertebrates that have internal fertilization and a scaly body and are cold-blooded. Most species have short legs (or none) and long tails, and most lay eggs. Living reptiles include the scaly reptiles, the crocodiles, the turtles, and the unique tuatara. Being cold-blooded, reptiles are not found in very cold regions; in regions with cold winters, they usually hibernate. They range in size from geckos that measure about 1 inch long to the python, which grows to 30 ft; the largest turtle, the marine leatherback, weighs about 1,500 lb. Extinct reptiles include the dinosaurs, the pterosaurs, and the dolphinlike ichthyosaurs.</p>
