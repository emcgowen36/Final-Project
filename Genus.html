<h1>Genus</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This website will explore the Canis Genus and explore the rest of the classifications under the genus. Here will be where you can learn about some of the species that are apart of the Canis Genus. Then you can take a deeper dive into the linked species below!</p>
<h2>Canis</h2>
<p>Canis spcies can range in weight from 22 lbs to 154 lbs. Coyotes Canis latrans and jackals Canis aureus & Canis adustus are in the smaller size range. The Ethiopian wolf Canis simensis, red wolf Canis rufus and the grey wolves Canis lupus are all significantly larger in height and weight with males typically over 132 lbs. Male and female canids are all similar in looks, with males slightly larger in body mass than females. Coat patterns and colors vary among species but common coat colors include: brown, black, grey, white, and red. Seasonal coat changes occur in canids that reside at high latitudes such as C. lupus and C. latrans. Common features of Canids include an elongated rostrum, with large canine teeth, and a broad gait which makes covering long distances in search of prey more efficient.</p>
<h2>Species a Part of the Canis Genus</h2>
<p>Every genus in biology have their own species. The species separates the animals into their final classification(species). Here are some of the most easily recognized species in this genus:

  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Canis Adustus</h2><img src="Images/Canis-Adustus.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>The side-striped jackal is easily distinguishable from its other jackal relatives. It is slightly more drab in color, and has shorter legs and ears. These jackals tend to be light gray to tan and are distinguishable by a white tip on their relatively dark tails. They tend to have a white stripe from elbow to hip and black side stripes which are not always conspicuous. This jackal species tends to be heavily built and is sexuallly dimorphic in size, males are somewhat larger than females. Males range from 16 to 26.5 lbs, whereas females are seldom known to weigh more than 22 lbs.</p>
<h2>Canis Aureus</h2><img src="Images/Canis-Aureus.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>The body length of the golden jackal is 27.5 to 33.5 in., with a tail length of about 9.8 in. Its standing height is approximately 15.7 in. The fur is generally coarse and not very long. Its coat is usually yellow to pale gold and brown-tipped, but the color can vary with season and region. On the Serengeti Plain in Northern Tanzania, golden jackals are brown-tipped yellow in the rainy season (December-January), changing to pale gold in the dry season (September-October).</p>
<h2>Canis Latrans</h2><img src="Images/Canis-Latrans.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Coloration of coyotes varies from grayish brown to a yellowish gray on the upper parts. The throat and belly are whitish. The forelegs, sides of head, muzzle and feet are reddish brown. The back has fulvous colored underfur and long, black-tipped guard hairs that produce a black dorsal stripe and a dark cross on the shoulder area. The tail, which is half the body length, is bottle shaped with a black tip. There is also a scent gland located on the dorsal base of the tail. There is one moult per year, which starts in May with light loss of hair and ends in July after profuse shedding. Coyotes are significantly smaller than gray wolves and much larger than foxes. Coyotes are distinguished from domesticated dogs by their pointed, erect ears and drooping tail, which they hold below their back when running. The eyes have a yellow iris and round pupil. The nose is black and usually less than one inch in diameter. The ears are large in relation to the head and the muzzle is long and slender. The feet are relatively small for the size of the body. The pes has four digits and the manus has five with a small first digit. Coyotes run on their toes (digitigrade). The dental formula is 3/3 1/1 4/4 2/3. The molars are structured for crushing and the canines are rather long and slender.</p>
<h2>Canis Lupus</h2><img src="Images/Canis-Lupus.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>The largest of approximately 41 wild species of canids, gray wolves vary in size based primarily on geographic locality, with southern populations generally smaller than northern populations. Total body length, from tip of the nose to tip of the tail, is from 39 to 51 in. in males, and 34 to 46 in. in females. Tail length ranges between 13 to 20 in. Males can weigh from 66 to 176 lbs., with an average of 121 lbs, females can weigh from 50 to 121 lbs, with an average of 99 lbs. Height (measured from base of paws to shoulder) generally ranges from 23.6 to 35.4 in. Distance between the canines is around 1.5 in. Fur color of gray wolves also varies geographically, ranging from pure white in Arctic populations, to mixtures of white with gray, brown, cinammon, and black to nearly uniform black in some color phases.</p>
<p>North American populations have three distinct color phases. The normal phase is characterized by varying mixtures of white with shades of black, gray, cinnamon, and brown on the upper parts of the animal. The back is usually more profoundly black, and the muzzle, ears, and limbs have cinammon coloration as well. Under parts are whitish and the tail is conspicuously black over the tail gland, and paler below to the tip, which is nearly pure black. The black phase of North American populations is characterized by the upper parts varying from brown to black, with specks of white; the underparts are paler in tone, and there is often a pure white medial pectoral spot. The third color phase occurs during the first pelage of young wolves. The upper parts are drab-gray, overlaid with brownish-black. The underparts are paler as well, and the ears vary from black to buffy, depending on the subspecies. Gray wolves have a dense underfur layer, providing them with excellent insulation against cold conditions. Gray wolves can be distinguished from red wolves (Canis rufus) by their larger size, broader snout, and shorter ears. They are distinguished from coyotes (Canis latrans) by being 50 to 100% larger and having a broader snout and larger feet.</p>
<h2>Canis Mesomelas</h2><img src="Images/Canis-Mesomelas.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>The main characteristic of the black-backed jackal, which gives it its name, is the black hair running from the back of the neck to the tail. The chest is white, and the under parts are white to rusty-white, whereas the rest of the body ranges from reddish brown to ginger in appearance. Adults stand about 15 in. at the shoulder and are nearly a meter long in length. The head is dog-like, with a pointed muzzle and high pointed ears. The winter coat of male adults develops a reddish to an almost deep russet red color. Females tend to be less richly colored. Sexual dimorphism does exist; males tend to be larger than females, but this difference is small.</p>
<h2>Canis Rufus</h2><img src="Images/Canis-Rufus.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Red wolves are distinguished from their nearest relative, Canis lupus, by their smaller size, relatively narrower proportions, longer legs and ears, and shorter fur. Red wolves have a total length between 39 and 51 in, tail length of from 11 to 16 in, and shoulder height of 25 to 31 in. Among red wolves, males average 10 percent larger than females. Red wolves usually have upperparts that are a mixture of cinnamon, tawny, and gray or black, while the back is normally blackish. The muzzle and limbs are tawny and the tail is tipped with black. In winter, the reddish element of the pelage is dominant. An annual molt takes place in the summer.</p>
<h2>Canis Simensis</h2><img src="Images/Canis-Simensis.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100">
<p>Ethiopian wolves are long-limbed, slender looking canids. They have a reddish coat with white marking on the legs, underbelly, tail, face, and chin. The boundary between the red and white fur is quite distinct. White markings on the face include a characteristic white crescent below the eyes and a white spot on the cheeks. The chin and throat are also white. The tail is marked with an indistinct black stripe down its length and a brush of black hairs at the tip. The ears are wide and pointed and the nose, gums, and palate are black. Females are generally paler in color than males and are smaller overall. There are five toes on the front feet and four on the rear feet. Males measure from 36.5 to 39.8 in. (average 37.9 in.) and females from 33.1 to 37.7 in.(average 36.1 in.). Males weigh from 31.3 to 42.5 lbs. (average 35.7) and females from 24.7 to 31.3 lbs. (average 28.2). The tail is from 10.6 to 15.5 in. in length. The dental formula is 3/3:1/1:4/4:2/3, with the lower third molar being absent occasionally.</p>
